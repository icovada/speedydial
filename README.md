Speedydial
==========

This script allows you to export the personal phonebooks and speeddials from Cisco's Call Manager.

This can come in handy for example for migrations.
If a client has a few hundred analog phones each with their own speed dials, you can import them all into the new IP phones without having to do this by hand.
(Yes the user can do it on its own in the ucmuser interface, no most users aren't able to do it)
